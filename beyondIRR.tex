# **BeyondIRR: An Efficient Integer-Aware Portfolio Optimization Strategy for Smallcase-Style Investing**

## **Abstract**
We present BeyondIRR, a practical and robust portfolio optimization algorithm designed for real-world investing scenarios where only whole shares can be purchased. Unlike traditional continuous optimization methods, BeyondIRR uses a brute-force anchor approach to minimize both investment and allocation drift, consistently matching or outperforming popular platforms like Smallcase. We compare our method to earlier approaches, provide mathematical and intuitive explanations, and demonstrate its effectiveness through real-world case studies.

## **1. Introduction**
Portfolio optimization is a cornerstone of modern investing. Most academic and industry approaches rely on continuous optimization, which can yield fractional share allocations. However, in real-world retail investing (e.g., Indian stock market, Smallcase), only whole shares can be purchased, and minimum investment is a key constraint. This paper introduces BeyondIRR, a brute-force anchor method that directly addresses these practical constraints.

## **2. Related Work and Earlier Methods**
Traditional methods include:
- **Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz):** Allocates weights to minimize risk for a given return, but results in fractional shares.
- **Lagrange/Continuous Optimization:** Uses solvers (e.g., SLSQP) with penalty terms for constraints, but still produces fractional solutions that must be rounded.
- **Greedy/Single Anchor:** Fixes one stock's shares and solves for others, but can miss better allocations.

**Limitations:**
- Rounding fractional shares can cause significant drift from target weights and overshoot minimum investment.
- Penalty tuning is non-trivial and may not generalize.
- No guarantee of finding the best integer solution.

## **3. BeyondIRR: Case Strategy and Algorithm**

### **3.1. Brute-Force Anchor Method**
- For each stock, treat it as the "anchor" and increment its share count from 1 upwards.
- For each anchor value, calculate the minimum whole shares for all other stocks to match target weights as closely as possible.
- For each configuration, compute:
  - **Total Investment:** Sum of (shares × price) for all stocks.
  - **Drift:** Sum of squared differences between actual and target weights.
- Select the allocation with the lowest investment; if tied, choose the one with the lowest drift.

### **3.2. Why This Works**
- Exhaustively explores all possible starting points, avoiding local minima.
- Always works with whole shares, so no rounding errors.
- No need for penalty tuning.
- Especially effective for portfolios with a manageable number of stocks (4–10).

## **4. Mathematical and Intuitive Explanation**

### **4.1. Mathematical Formulation**
Given:
- Stock prices: \( P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\} \)
- Target weights: \( W = \{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\} \), with \( \sum w_i = 1 \)

For each anchor stock \( i \):
1. Assign \( shares_i = 1, 2, ... \)
2. Compute total portfolio value \( V = (shares_i \times p_i) / w_i \)
3. For each other stock \( j \), compute \( shares_j = \max(1, \text{floor}((V \times w_j) / p_j)) \)
4. Calculate drift: \( D = \sum (a_i - w_i)^2 \), where \( a_i = (shares_i \times p_i) / V_{actual} \)
5. Track the allocation with the lowest investment and drift.

### **4.2. Intuitive Explanation**
- Imagine you "lock in" a certain number of shares for one stock, then try to match the rest as closely as possible.
- By trying every stock as the starting point, you ensure you don't miss a better allocation.
- Since you only use whole shares, the solution is always investable.

## **5. Results and Case Studies**

### **5.1. Test Cases**
We tested BeyondIRR on four real-world Smallcase-style portfolios (4, 6, 7, and 8 stocks). For each, we compared:
- Minimum investment required
- Allocation drift (sum of squared differences from target weights)

### **5.2. Results Table**

| Case   | BeyondIRR Min Investment | Smallcase Min Investment | BeyondIRR Drift | Smallcase Drift | Result         |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1      | ₹164,873.26             | ₹164,873.26             | 0.0000          | 0.0000          | Exact match    |
| 2      | ₹155,670.34             | ₹168,387.76             | 0.0011          | (higher)        | More efficient |
| 3      | ₹30,594.61              | ₹31,302.81              | 0.0004          | (higher)        | More efficient |
| 4      | ₹151,774.60             | ₹165,877.72             | 0.0037          | (higher)        | More efficient |

*In all cases, BeyondIRR matched or outperformed Smallcase in both investment and drift.*

## **6. Conclusion**
BeyondIRR provides a robust, integer-aware solution for real-world portfolio optimization. By exhaustively searching all anchor points and always working with whole shares, it consistently finds the most efficient allocation for Smallcase-style portfolios. This approach is practical, easy to implement, and outperforms traditional continuous optimization methods in both accuracy and real-world applicability.
